* Handling HEAD does not work (2 ignored tests)
* Handle X-METHOD-OVERRIDE header
* Handle tunneling PUT and DELETE through POST for HTML forms
** Consider using another route handler decorator, and doing it like Rails (_method form data)
* Handle media type modifiers (e.g. text/html; q=0.8)
** Test backward routing (creating URLs) with multiple routes
* Map HEAD and OPTIONS even without subclassing (take the controller name as a parameter)
