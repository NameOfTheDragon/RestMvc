* Handling HEAD does not work (2 ignored tests)
* Handle X-METHOD-OVERRIDE header
* Handle tunneling PUT and DELETE through POST for HTML forms
** Consider using another route handler decorator, and doing it like Rails (_method form data)
* Handle media type modifiers (e.g. text/html; q=0.8)
* Route multiple routes to one action
** Test backward routing (creating URLs) with multiple routes
* Don't add formatted routes automatically - allow the user to if he wants them
** Hard to do if each route is a separate attribute - ordering is important, but
   attribute order may not be maintained through reflection.  May have to use a single
   attribute with a params set of uris
* Add convenient way to map all RestfulControllers in assembly
* Don't force inheritance - allow using the attribute routing without RestfulController
** All you give up is auto handling of HEAD, OPTIONS, 405 - and even these can be handled (without customization) by internally creating a controller
